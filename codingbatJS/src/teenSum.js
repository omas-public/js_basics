/* question

Given 2 ints, a and b, return their sum. However, "teen" values in the range 13..19 inclusive, are extra lucky. So if either value is a teen, just return 19.

teenSum(3, 4) → 7
teenSum(10, 13) → 19
teenSum(13, 2) → 19

const teenSum = (a, b) => {
// write code here


}


module.exports.teenSum = teenSum
